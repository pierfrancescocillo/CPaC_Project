# Psychedelic Theremin
## Interactive Theremin controlling a Game of Life
 
As a project for the Creative Computing and Programming course we developed a Theremin, based on color tracking, and the Game of life, whose patterns are controlled by the frequency and volume parameters of the Theremin.

## How to use

To use our interactive theremin the user must choose two physical, different-colored object that will control the Theremin. We suggest to use two pens with different-colored tips.

After choosing the objects, the user must set the frequency and volume colors parameters (defined in our program as FreqtrackColor and VoltrackColor) in order to, more or less, match the colors of the two physical objects that he wants to use. The two colors must be different from one another in order to properly control the Theremin. 

The user can also decide a threshold for the two colors (changing the thresholdVol and thresholdFreq variables), in order to properly adjust the tracking done by the algorithm. These thresholds can also be changed during the execution of the program by using certain keys (key "w" to increase the thresholdFreq, key "s" to decrease it, key "e" to increase the thresholdVol, key "d" to decrease it).

For controlling the Volume, the physical-colored object matching the VoltrackColor must be moved in vertical direction, up and down. For controlling the Frequency, the physical-colored object matching the FreqtrackColor must be moved near and far from the camera.

To start to play, we suggest to first run the supercollider ("Theremin") script and then processing one(ColorTrackGol_final).

We also reccomend to play the application using a background as neutral as possibile (in order to avoid interference with the color tracking) and also to avoid natural light in the view of the camera, that can distort processing perception of the colors.

## Design
In our application the screen is splitted in two: the left side recives inputs from the user camera while the right side implements the Game of Life.
The color tracking and the Game of Life algorithms are implemented in Processing, while we take advantage of Supercollider to convert the inputs percived from the user camera in sound.

### Color Tracking

For both of the colors, the algorithm will scan every pixel of the camera and determine if a particulary pixel has the same color of the VoltrackColor or FreqtrackColor parameter.

This tecnique is then improved by using the blob detection method: the algorithm not only determined if a pixel's color is close to the one assigned to the Volume or Frequency parameter, but also determine if the pixel belong to a specific region of close pixels of the same color. 

That's the use of the arrays of objects VolRegion and FreqRegion: every element of these arrays is an object of class region, and every object of class region is composed by an array of coordinates of pixels (represented by PVectors), and an int value.

Every time a new pixel of a particular color is tracked, the algorithm takes the array of objects for that specific color, takes the first region of this array and compute the distance between every pixel of this region and the current tracked pixel. If, for at least one pixel belonging to the region, this distance is less then a certain threashold, called distThreshold, then the pixel belong to that region. Otherwise we take the following region in the array of objects and repeat the procedure. If no region is found for a specific pixel (that means that the pixel is not enough close to any region in order to assign it to that region), a new region is created. This is implemented because, to evaluate the Volume and Frequency parameters, only regions with a certain amount of pixels will be taken into account, in order to avoid the tracking of small-background region whose pixels color match a tracked color. But due to the fact that this only works for regions with less than 550 pixels in our algorithm, is still preferable to choose neutral background while playing.


### Frequency and Volume Mapping
In our application the frequency of the instruement changes if we get close or far to the camera with the frequency- controlling physical object, while the volume changes depending on the vertical position of the Volume-controlling physical object.

The specific parameter that controls the frequency is the number of pixels beloning to the region (because more pixels means we are closer to the camera and viceversa), while the parameter that controls the Volume is the vertical (y position) of the central pixel of the region (at the bottom of the camera we will have no sound).

Both of this parameters are mapped in a specific Volume or Frequency, and sent using a OSC message to Supercollider.
In particular, the frequency is mapped in a value between 130.81 (Frequency of a C3) and 1046.5 (Frequency of a C6), allowing the theremin to cover three octaves, while the Volume is mapped in 0-1.

### Sound Synthesis

To synthesize the sound of the theremin, we implemented a trivial syntheziser using Supercollider. It is based simply on a sinusoidal oscillator moduled by an ASR envelope. The frequency parameter of the oscillator is controlled by an OSC message, receved directly from the main Processing algorithm. As for the frequency, also the amplitude of the envelope is controlled in the ssame way with another OSC message.
Here follows the definition of the synth:
```
SynthDef(\theremin, {
  arg atk=0.01,rel=0.1,crv= -3;
  var freq, synth, vol, amp,env;
  freq = \freq.kr(440,1.1);
  amp = \amp.kr(0,1.1);
  env = EnvGen.ar(Env.asr(atk,1,rel,crv),1);
  synth = SinOsc.ar(freq);
  if(freq!=0,{Out.ar(0,synth*env*amp)},{Out.ar(0,0)});
}
```


### Game of life
The classical Game of Life is a 2D grid cellular automata, in which each cell is "alive" or "dead" depending on the state of it's neighbors.

Being a 2D gird, each cell has 8 neighbors that can be dead or alive, as itself, so there are 512 possible neighbourhoods situations. Nevertheless, the situation becomes interesting when we base the behavior of each cell on the number of death and alive neighbors it has.

Typically, when a cell is alive, it can die in two ways:
* Overpopulation: if the cell has three or more neighbors
* Loneliness: if it has one or no neighbors

Instead, if it is dead, it can come to life if it has exactly three neighbors. In all the other cases, it will preserve it's current status.
This ruleset governing the Game of Life can be summarized with the following line of code:

```
  ruleset = {0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,      0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0};
```
where the value 1 states if a cell is alive, 0 if it is dead.
One of the first eight walues will be the next status of the cell if is alive (the first if it has one neighbor, the second if it has two, ecc...), and one of the other eight will apply if it is dead.

Starting from this point, we modified the ruleset as a function of the frequency. For each octave, the frequency is mapped in one of seven possible intervals, each one of them arbitrarily centered around each note of the major diatonic scale in the key of C.

So we defined a set of seven different ruleset, starting from the classical one seen above, chosing which one applyes in the current time instant based according to the corresponding interval to which the current frequency played belongs. We have done this, Ã§a va sans dire, so that the user is able to create and experience different graphic patterns, changing depending on the melody he or she is playing.

These are the ruleset we chose to implement:

* C: ```ruleset = {1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,      1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0};```
* D: ```ruleset = {0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,      0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0};```
* E: ```ruleset = {0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0};```
* F: ```ruleset = {0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,      0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0};```
* G: ```ruleset = {0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,      0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0};```
* A: ```ruleset = {0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,      0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0};```
* B: ```ruleset = {0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,      0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0};```

It is possible to see that some ruleset tend to overcrowd the seen, some of them tend to empty it, while some other produce a more stable situation. This choice has made so that, following the variations of the playing melody, the scene generated could be as much diversified as possible.

Furthermore, taking inspiration from the Cycle 2D Grid algorithm, we did not consider only "dead" or "alive" status for the cells, but also intermediate states of live. Or, maybe, it would be better to call them *states of death*. As a matter of fact, when the cell dies it does not fade immediately, but it's color changes based on the number of frame that have passed from when it was alive, until eventually it vanishes completely. 

To do so, we mapped the number of frames that have passed into an range between two colors: the "starting" color, when the cell is alive, and the "final" color, when the cell is almost vanished. 

We want to highlight the fact that those two colors are not always the same, but they change based on the volume of the theremin, controlled by the user.
We, infact, subdivided the volume interval into a set of five intermediate ranges equally spaced, and assigned to each range a starting and a final color.

Summarizing, we designed our Game of Life so that the user will control the graphical pattern on the screen controlling the frequency, and the colors controlling the volume.
